	<h3>The algorithm</h3>
	<p>Due to the fact that there are many data points in the training data set we could consider taking only a part of it, to begin with. For example, to work just with the first 1000 data points.</p>
	<p>An alternative could be to get just a subset of the training data, for certain parameters or reduce the number of variables using the Principal Components Analysis.</p>
	<p>This is a classification problem and therefore we could run the recursive partitioning method.</p>
